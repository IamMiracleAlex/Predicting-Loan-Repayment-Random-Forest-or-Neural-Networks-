# Predicting-Loan-Repayment-Random-Forest-or-Neural-Networks-

This repository demonstrates how to build a model from scratch up to evaluation and selection.  
We will show how to wrangle real world data, prepare the data, sample the data, scale it and build two loan pre-delinquency models.

We will then comprehensively compare them and select one for implementation.

We would build a Random Forest Model and a Neural Network model.
